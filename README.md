# About.me

This repository is used to version the content of my personal website. The site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on Github Pages at <https://vthiery.github.io/>.

## How to build

First, download and install [v0.96.x of Hugo extended](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases). Then, test the site locally with

```sh
> hugo server -D
```
