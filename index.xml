      <description>This tutorial will guide you through the setup of a Forensic lab using:
 VirtualBox 7 REMnux + Sift on Ubuntu 20.04 FlareVM on Windows 10  It is mostly a summary of notes I took while building my own lab.
Disclaimer Do not follow this guide blindly!
Be very careful during the setup of your forensic lab, especially if you intend to manipulate and/or detonate malware. I am in no way responsible for any harm or damage you may cause and you should always make sure you are operating in a safe environment.</description>
