      <title>Reverse Engineering the &#34;Bomb Lab&#34; with Cutter</title>

      <description>Context I recently took the excellent &amp;ldquo;Architecture 1001: x86-64 Assembly&amp;rdquo; course offered by Xeno Kovah on OpenSecurityTraining2 to consolidate my knowledge of x86-64 assembly. The final assignment consists in solving the &amp;ldquo;Bomb Lab&amp;rdquo;.
Although the course suggests to use gdb or WinDbg, I decided to do it differently and use Cutter with the following constraints:
 Not using debug symbols - this is something Xeno actually recommends if one has some reverse-engineering experience, or want extra challenge Perform a pure static analysis - using gdb/gef would be much smarter here, but I really wanted to practice static analysis Not using rz-ghidra or any decompiler since that would defeat the whole point of the exercise  I used Cutter Version 2.</description>

      <description>This tutorial will guide you through the setup of a Forensic lab using:
 VirtualBox 7 REMnux + Sift on Ubuntu 20.04 FlareVM on Windows 10  It is mostly a summary of notes I took while building my own lab.
Disclaimer Do not follow this guide blindly!
Be very careful during the setup of your forensic lab, especially if you intend to manipulate and/or detonate malware. I am in no way responsible for any harm or damage you may cause and you should always make sure you are operating in a safe environment.</description>

      <description>TL;DR  I am currently working as CISO for Edgelab / Evooq in Switzerland. Also worked as SRE (2y), Software Engineer (3y+), and Quant (2y+). Before that, I studied maths, physics, and quantitative finance. I&amp;rsquo;m curious, enjoy learning new things, and passionate about cybersecurity. I speak French and English. Feel free to contact me by email.  Experiences &amp;mdash; Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) @ Edgelab / Evooq Since Sep 2021</description>
